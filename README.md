Saturday is cool :3

hi and welcome to my stupid thing.

vivid/stasis Portable! (aka i used a steam emu to crack steam)

By releasing this, I mean NO harm to the original creators. If you're here you probably already know the game. If not, Check it out!
All credit for the game goes to Team vividstasis for the game, and the goldenberg emulator for steam cracking.

Please, do not report any bugs. I most likely wont fix them anyway. Once again. I take no credit for anything.

The save location should be inside the game folder. 

The game had to be split into two parts. Put data.win inside the game folder. Otherwise you're not gonna launch.

Enjoy!
